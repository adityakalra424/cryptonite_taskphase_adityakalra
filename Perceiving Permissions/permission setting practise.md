# permission setting practise
## INTRODUCTION 
In this 7th challenge we have to solve the problem by setting the permission for the `/challenge/pwn` in the order asked to get the flag using `chmod` and `=` and `-`.In this challenge we learn about `=` and how `=` is used to set the permission for the file. we also learn about `-` which is used when u want to remove all 
permissions for `user/group/other`.

You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

Current permissions of "/flag": ---------
- the user doesn't have read permissions
- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
- the world doesn't have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$ chmod u=r /flag
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$ cat /flag
