# Chaining with semicolons
## INTRODUCTION 
In the 1st challenge,we learn how to chain commands using `;` semicolons.In this challenge,we have to run `/challenge/pwn` and then `/challenge/college`, chaining them with a `;` semicolon.I wrote `/challenge/pwn; /challenge/college` to get the flag.
## CODE
```bash
Connected!
hacker@chaining~chaining-with-semicolons:~$ /challenge/pwn; /challenge/college
Yes! You chained /challenge/pwn and /challenge/college! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{Y2WC6xWKPEApF0K-O6bdYGvTB0w.dVTN4QDL4YDN0czW}
```
