# Searching Manuals
## INTRODUCTION 
In the 4th challenge, we have to search the manual using `/` command or `?` command. Using the `/` command we have to find the arguement that will work with the program and print me the flag.
In this case the argument was `-b`.So i typed `/challenge/challenge -b` to print the flag.
