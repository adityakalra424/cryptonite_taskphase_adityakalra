# Intro To Commands 
## EXPLANATION 
First, I connected `pwn.college` to my terminal using the SSH key. Then, I solved the first task, which was to invoke the `hello` command to get the flag by typing `hello`.After that, I copy-pasted the generated flag into the `pwn.college` site.
## CODE
```bash
adityakalra@DESKTOP-BBS45RH:~$ ssh -i ./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
Connected!
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{QKNbUqoVDERDF-tHVJpVDcX7PV2.ddjNyUDL4YDN0czW}
```
