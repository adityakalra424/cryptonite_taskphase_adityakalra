# Setting variables
## INTRODUCTION 
In the 2nd challenge,we have to set the `PWN` variable to the value `COLLEGE` using `=`.To solve the challenge, I wrote `PWN=COLLEGE` to assign the value `COLLEGE` to the variable `PWN`.
## CODE
```bash
Connected!
hacker@variables~setting-variables:~$ PWN=COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{svcuhzCwDw__md78mnkXVz4YQk_.dlTN1QDL4YDN0czW}
```
## RESOURCES
