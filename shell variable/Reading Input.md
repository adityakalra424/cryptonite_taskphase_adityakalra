# Reading Input
## INTRODUCTION 
In the 7th challenge, we have to use `read` to set the `PWN` variable to the value `COLLEGE`.I wrote `read -p "INPUT:" PWN` in which i wrote `-p` argument to print `INPUT` onto the command line and wrote `read` to take an input into the variable `PWN`, 
then i wrote `COLLEGE` to set the value of the variable `PWN` to `COLLEGE` and get the flag.
## CODE
``` bash
hacker@variables~reading-input:~$ read -p "INPUT:" PWN
INPUT:COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{w0GQFlQUDCH5fFRBajTzfS3GWmH.dhzN1QDL4YDN0czW}
```
