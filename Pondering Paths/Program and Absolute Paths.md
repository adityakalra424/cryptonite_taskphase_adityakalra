# Program and Absolute Paths
## EXPLANATION 
The second task is to excute the `run` file that is in the `challenge` directory that is, in turn, in the `/` directory. I have to envoke its absolute path to excute the `run` file .
I typed `/challenge/run` in the terminal which is the absolute path to the `run` file to complete the task.Then i copy pasted the generated flag into the `pwn.college` site.
## CODE
```bash
hacker@paths~program-and-absolute-paths:~$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{EBOXuOrNUMlaFU9EWGN90_pUeUV.dVDN1QDL4YDN0czW}
```
