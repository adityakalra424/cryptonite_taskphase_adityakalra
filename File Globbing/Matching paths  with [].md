# Matching paths with []
## INTRODUCTION 
In the 4th challenge, we have to run `/challenge/run` with a single argument that bracket-globs into the absolute paths to the `file_b, file_a, file_s, and file_h` files.We can do that by writing the argument as
`/challenge/files/file_[bash]` and the command as `/challenge/run`.
## CODE
``` bash
Connected!
hacker@globbing~matching-paths-with-:~$ /challenge/run /challenge/files/file_[bash]
You got it! Here is your flag!
