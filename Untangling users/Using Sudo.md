# Using Sudo
## INTRODUCTION
## CODE
In the 4th challenge, we learn the use of `sudo`,How `sudo`  defaults to running a command as `root`. In this challenge we have to get the flag by running `cat /flag` as a `root` user by using `sudo`.I wrote `sudo cat /flag` where `sudo` lets me run the `cat /flag` as a `root` user so that i can get the flag.
```bash
Connected!
hacker@users~using-sudo:~$ sudo cat /flag
