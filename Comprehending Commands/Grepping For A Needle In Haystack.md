# Grepping For A Needle In Haystack
## EXPLANATION 
In the fourth task,we need to search a file for lines of text containing a `search string` and print them to the console using the `grep` command.
To solve this, I wrote the command  `grep pwn.college /challenge/data.txt` where `grep` is the command, `pwn.college` is the search string and `/challenge/data.txt` is the file from where we get the flag.
Then i copy pasted the generated flag into the `pwn.college` site.
