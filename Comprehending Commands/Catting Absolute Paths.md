# Catting Absolute Paths
## EXPLANATION 
In the second task,we have to read a file named `flag` using the `cat` command but the `flag` is not in the home directory.The `flag` files absolute path is `/flag`.
To solve the problem,I typed `cat` which is the command and `/flag` which is the absolute path of the file  we need to read.
Then i copy pasted the generated flag into the `pwn.college` site.
