# Removing Files
## INTRODUCTION 
In the seventh task, we had to remove a file using the `rm` command. I first created a file named `delete_me` using the `touch` command and then deleted it using the `rm` command. Then i run `/challenge/run` to finish the challenge.
After solving the challenge, I copy pasted the generated flag in the `pwn.college` site.
## CODE
``` bash
Connected!
hacker@commands~removing-files:~$ touch delete_me
hacker@commands~removing-files:~$ rm delete_me
hacker@commands~removing-files:~$ /challenge/check
Excellent removal. Here is your reward:
