# Redirecting output 
## INTRODUCTION 
In the 1st challenge, we have to use the input redirection to write the word  `PWN`(all uppercase) to the filename `COLLEGE` (all uppercase).
We can do this by writing `echo PWN > COLLEGE` where `echo PWN` outputs the word `PWN` and we redirect it to the file `COLLEGE` using `>`.
## CODE
```bash
Connected!
You have created the COLLEGE file, but you didn't write the correct value to
it. Make sure to write PWN to the COLLEGE file.
hacker@piping~redirecting-output:~$ echo PWN > COLLEGE
Correct! You successfully redirected 'PWN' to the file 'COLLEGE'! Here is your
flag:
pwn.college{QSJaKNsFGQdvJmA0Yu1nw7IWzFd.dRjN1QDL4YDN0czW}
```
