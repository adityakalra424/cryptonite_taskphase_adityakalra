# Interrupting Processes
## INTRODUCTION 
In the 3rd challenge,we learn the use of hotkey `Ctrl-C` that sends an `interrupt` to whatever
application is waiting on input from the terminal and, typically, this causes the application 
to cleanly exit.
## CODE
``` bash
Connected!
hacker@processes~interrupting-processes:~$ /challenge/run
I could give you the flag... but I won't, until this process exits. Remember,
you can force me to exit with Ctrl-C. Try it now!
^C 
Good job! You have used Ctrl-C to interrupt this process! Here is your flag:
